"Hey you! You can't come down this way. My sheep are grazing here, and I won't let strangers near them. You are a stranger, right? I can't really see your face clearly." He squints at you.

"I guess if you want to be my friend... we could become friends. Do you like sheep as much as me?" You talk for a while, and you think you're persuading him, but then he says, "I can't help but feel suspicious. What if you're just using me to get to my sheep?"
+ {not monocle} "I'll get you a gift to prove my friendship. Something you could use." ->cyclopschoices

He teaches you a little trick to tell if a sheep is thirsty or sad. 
+ [+1 Sheep Whisperer]

{not whitewool: The cyclops lets you shear a sheep. The sheep clearly enjoys the cool breeze now it's not so woolly. You put the sheep shears back, as the Cyclops wants to keep them. ->whitewool }
{whitewool: The cyclops is happy to let you shear another sheep, and the sheep loves that too, but he has a livelihood to maintain, so he won't let you take any more wool for yourself. You put the sheep shears back, as the Cyclops wants to keep them. ->cyclopschoices }
