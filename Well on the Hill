+ [Go East, back down the hill] ->atsignpost 
+ [Enter the Observatory.] ->place_observatory
+ [Examine Area] ->coinandview
+ [Examine Broken Well] ->brokenwell
+ [Travel directly to somewhere you've already visited] ->fasttravelfromhill
+ [Check what you're carrying] ->inventorywell
 
==coinandview
You look around. You're quite high up and can see almost all of the island from here. The Observatory has white stone walls and a big domed roof. Behind it, you see the mast of a ship, tilted to one side.
+ {not coin} [What's that on the floor next to the well?] ->coin
+ {coin} There's nothing else in the grass. 
->wellchoices

==coin== 
You see a single silver coin. You pick it up. You now have another silver coin in your Inventory. 
+ [Every little coin will help.]
->wellchoices

==brokenwell==
The well has a winch and bar but you canâ€™t see a bucket or rope.
+ [Look down the well.] ->lookdownwell
+ {not coin} [Look around the well.] ->coin
+ [Step away again.] ->place_wellonhill

==lookdownwell==
 There is no water in the well, {not fishforbucket: and you can see a bucket with a handle in the well, attached to a rope.} {fishforbucket: and the bottom now has nothing interesting about it.} 
 + [Well, no fresh water for me.] ->notthirsty
 + {not fishforbucket} [I wish I had that bucket and the rope attached too... Think about it.] ->deepthoughts
 + [FOOLISHLY climb down the well without any safety measures!] ->stupidwellchoice 
 
 ==deepthoughts==
 That rope and bucket are sure to come in handy. If only I had a way of getting them without climbing down.
+ {fishingrod} [I could try and hook it with the fishing rod!] ->fishforbucket

==stupidwellchoice==
You climb down the well... or start to. Then you lose your footing and crack your head as you fall. It's a long way down.

You died!
+ Try again from the beginning.
    # RESTART
    -> END

==notthirsty==
Ah, well, you're not thirsty anyway. 
->wellchoices

==fishforbucket==
You use the fishing rod to hook the handle of the bucket, and reel it in. The bucket comes up, with the rope attached.
You now have 20 metres of rope and an Ordinary Bucket in your inventory.
