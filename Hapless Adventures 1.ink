CYCLOPS ISLAND
->ontheshipstart

===givecompass===
"Wow, what a beautiful compass! Now we'll be able to navigate on the sea! It even fits into this indent next to the ship's wheel! Thank you so much! {not giveblackbeard: I still need the black beard. } {not giveparrot: I still need a parrot. }

===giveblackbeard===
"This beard is so curly and black, it's perfect! Is this... squid ink? Hopefully it'll stay black when it dries, and it won't turn blue!"

===giveparrot===
You hand over the parrot to the Pirate Captain. The parrot says, "Hello Sexy! Hello Sexy!" The Pirate Captain is very pleased. "Such a compliment! We will be great friends, I think. With time, I'll find out if it says anything more."

 â€œThank you for bringing me everything I need! Now I am ready to set sail on an adventure! Would you like to come with me?

+  [NO] -> areyousure1 

==congrats1==
Congratulations, you have completed Chapter 1! 
->achievements


==areyousure1==
The Captain looks into your eyes, trying to work out if you're joking or not.
+ [Only joking, let's sail the seas!"] ->congrats1
+ [Yep, you're serious, all this questing was hard work, you'd prefer a peaceful life on the island.] ->peaceend

==peaceend==
The Pirate Captain thanks you for your help, and bids you farewell. He sails off into the sunset (which must be bad for his eyes) and you wave until you can't see him any more. You have made friends on Cyclops Island. You can fish for food. You could catch more animals for the Pet Shop. You could work with the Cyclops. You could do any number of things. And maybe one day, you could go explore the rest of the world. But not today.
+ CONGRATULATIONS! You have completed Chapter 1 of the Hapless Adventures! Down your path, there are no more adventures. But island life is bound to be a more relaxing experience. ->END

==achievements==
{cathome: You gained 1 point in Poignancy for the observing the transient nature of the Beautiful Fish. }
{flirt: You gained 1 point in Flirtatious for trying to pick up the Pirate Captain. }
{not flirt: You did not gain the achievement: +1 Flirtatious. }
{friendlycyclops: You unlocked the ability: +1 Sheep Whisperer, after chatting with the friendly Cyclops. }
{not friendlycyclops: You did not gain the achievement: +1 Sheep Whisperer. }
{ropetrouble: You unlocked the achievement: "Better to Have Roped and Lost..." The Game Creator spoke directly to you. }
{not ropetrouble: You did not gain the achievement: "Better to Have Roped and Lost..." }
{ (parrot && inventorysignpost || inventorywell || inventorywreck):   The parrot called you "Sexy" while you were alone. +1 Self-Esteem. }
{not (parrot && inventorysignpost || inventorywell || inventorywreck): You never found out if the parrot thought YOU were sexy, or if it was just complimenting those around you. You did not gain the achievement: +1 Self-Esteem. }
